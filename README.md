## Mark's Salesforce Dev Org

This is my personal Salesforce developer org where I build and track real-world enhancements and user stories to sharpen my platform development skills.

Each feature is designed to simulate business value, system design, and implementation just like in a real dev team (only this time, itâ€™s just me... and I get to pick the enhancements ðŸ˜„).
